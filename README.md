### Trying out using Github for DevOps Assignment

## Task
* Create a GitHub repository that contains your application code, along with workflows that execute steps to test, package, or deploy it.
* Pushing new commits to the repository should trigger a workflow that does something with your code. It could be a notification on a chat app, executing tests, packaging it up, or deploying it to the cloud. Bonus points if you do several of these, but that is not the expectation.

## Steps
* Writing the script on README.MD
* State the Workflow
* Create Application Source Code
